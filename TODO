Integration tests for:
- many pipes and piping commands and events in every possible direction
- monitoring systembus with 1 pipe

- handler methods with namespace annotations (?possible)
- testing closures

12) Create a crafics/cqrs-php packagist package to fully support the installation with composer. 
Custom repositories like github can only be defined in the root package, 
see http://getcomposer.org/doc/04-schema.md#repositories. 
That means, I cannot declare crafics/cqrs-php in my zf2-cqrs-module as dependency, until the consumer of 
my ZF2 module defines the repository link to crafics/cqrs-php in it's composer.json. This makes thinks complicated.

DONE: https://packagist.org/packages/crafics/cqrs-php
