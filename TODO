AdapterTrait
------------

1)
"allow" becomes private since we can always easily use "initializeBus" like so:
$this->adapter->initializeBus(
    $this->bus,
    array('Test\Integration\Test2\Test2Handler')
);


2) - DONE
"initializeBus" will be renamed to "pipe".
"pipe" could be __THE__ adapter main integration function cia configuration


3)
Full coverage!!!


4)
Integration tests for:
- all exceptions which we should redesign from scratch probably(?)
- many pipes and piping commands and events in every possible direction
- monitoring systembus with 1 pipe
- monitoring systembus with man pipes
- handler methods with multiple annotations (could be use as input or output handler)
- handler methods with namespace annotations (?possible)
- testing closures
- Gate not static (?)
- configuration testing


5)
maybe adapter implementation for closures possible?

function simple_printer($name) {
    return function () use ($name) {
        print $name;
    };
}


6) - DONE
do we need "command_map" key in configuration
-> 'command_map' => array(
Can't we use "interface_exists('CommandInterface')" or "interface_exists('EventInterface')" ???

AM: Good point, I've implemented it.

7)
configuration looks like this right now:
'adapter' => array(
    'class' => 'Cqrs\Adapter\ArrayMapAdapter'
),
'buses' => array(
    'Test\Coverage\Mock\Bus\BusMock' => array(
        'command_map' => array(
            'Test\Coverage\Mock\Command\MockCommand' => array(
                'alias' => 'Test\Coverage\Mock\Command\MockCommandHandler',
                'method' => 'handleCommand'
            )
        )
    )
)
does it make sense to put the adapter->class into the handler?
Imagine there're different developers for every handler. we should give them the freedom
to decide which handler they implement.

AM: What about this version?

        $configuration = array(
            'adapters' => array(
                array(
                    'class' => 'Cqrs\Adapter\ArrayMapAdapter',
                    'buses' => array(
                        'Test\Coverage\Mock\Bus\BusMock' => array(
                            'Test\Coverage\Mock\Command\MockCommand' => array(
                                'alias' => 'Test\Coverage\Mock\Command\MockCommandHandler',
                                'method' => 'handleCommand'
                            )
                        )
                    )
                ),
                array(
                    'class' => 'Cqrs\Adapter\AnnotationAdapter',
                    'buses' => array(
                        'Test\Coverage\Mock\Bus\BusMock' => array(
                            'Test\Coverage\Mock\Command\AnnotationCommandHandler'
                        )
                    )
                ),
            ),
        );

- You can configure many adapters and each adapter gets it's own bus-configuration
- we have two advantages with this version:
    - we can use different adapters for different types of handlers
    - it is easier to understand, that each adapter type defines it's own bus-configuration format:
        - AnnotationAdapter only needs the FQCN
        - ArrayMapAdapter gets a message to handler mapping


8)
$this->getBus() <- without parameter returns the currents bus!
$this->getBus($name) <- returns any bus


9)
command/event mapping (?)
\                           <- allows every handler (which is default)
\namespace                  <- only namespace
\namespace\namespace        <- only namespace/namespace
\namespace\class            <- only class
\namespace\class\method     <- only method
