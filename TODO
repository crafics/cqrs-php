AdapterTrait
------------

4)
Integration tests for:
- many pipes and piping commands and events in every possible direction
- monitoring systembus with 1 pipe
- monitoring systembus with many pipes
- handler methods with multiple annotations (could be use as input or output handler)
- handler methods with namespace annotations (?possible)
- testing closures

12) Create a crafics/cqrs-php packagist package to fully support the installation with composer. 
Custom repositories like github can only be defined in the root package, 
see http://getcomposer.org/doc/04-schema.md#repositories. 
That means, I cannot declare crafics/cqrs-php in my zf2-cqrs-module as dependency, until the consumer of 
my ZF2 module defines the repository link to crafics/cqrs-php in it's composer.json. This makes thinks complicated.

DONE: https://packagist.org/packages/crafics/cqrs-php

13)
Add Handling of Queries: work in progress

14)
Split BusInterface into: 
    - BusInterface: getName(), setGate(), getGate()
    - CommandBusInterface: setCommandHandlerLoader(), mapCommand(), getCommandHandlerMap(), invokeCommand()
    - EventBusInterface: setEventListenerLoader(), registerEvent(), getEventListenerMap(), publishEvent()
    - QueryBusInterface: setQueryHandlerLoader(), mapQuery(), getQueryHandlerMap(), executeQuery()

Provide Traits for all 4 Types.

The AbstractBus implements all 4 interfaces and uses all 4 Traits to provide a simple setup with only one bus extending the AbstractBus.
If you want to work with specific buses, f.e. a seperate QueryBus you only need to implement BusInterface, QueryBusInterface and use BusTrait and QueryBusTrait.

15)
Rename property $arguments to $payload (for Commands, Events and Queries)

16)
Write UnitTests for new query stuff

17)
Add Query Annotation

18)
Find a solution to decouple system bus setup with hardcoded dependency to ClassMapLoaders

19)
Check, implement and test handling of transactions:
When and how should a transaction be started?
If a transaction fails, no Events should be published!

20)
Implement ConventionAdapter
