Looks like the problem with missing annotation classes is caused by a wrong phpunit setup.


imac:cqrs-php manfredweber$ php vendor/phpunit/phpunit/phpunit.php tests/
PHPUnit 3.7.25 by Sebastian Bergmann.

Configuration read from /Users/manfredweber/Documents/cqrs-php/phpunit.xml

..[Attach Error] Bus <mock-annotation-bus> is already attached!
..[Attach Error] Bus <mock-bus> is already attached!

Problem is that we require bootstrap to register the annottation classes!

Try this one from command line:

phpunit --bootstrap tests/bootstrap.php tests/
